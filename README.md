# CyberML

IoT Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning.

## Overview

This project implements classification and anomaly detection as part of the CYBERML course, for IoT network attacks using the [CIC IoT-DIAD 2024](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iot-diad-2024.html) dataset.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM
- **Classification**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Adversarial Attacks**: FGSM, PGD, and noise-based attacks

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
